//fractional knapsack is a greedy problem
//0-1 knapsack is a dynamic programing approach
//in 0-1 knapsack we can add either whole item or we cann not add but we cann not add fraction of items
//unbounded knapsack ,we have unlimited supply
//0-1 knapsack weight,value,capacity array are given
//in 0-1 we have to output maximum profit
